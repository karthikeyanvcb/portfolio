          <h2>About Me</h2>
          <p>
            I’m a blockchain and DeFi growth specialist with over three years of
            experience building communities, developing go‑to‑market plans and
            delivering cross‑functional marketing campaigns. I’m currently
            pursuing a Ph.D. at Cardiff Metropolitan University titled
            <em>“Enhancing DeFi Protocol Resilience Across Ethereum and Layer 2
            Networks: A Modular Framework for Secure, Scalable and Interoperable
            Financial Infrastructure”</em> (present–2028).  My master’s
            dissertation compared transaction fees across Arbitrum, Optimism and
            Polygon networks to understand layer‑2 scalability.  As a member of
            the university’s <strong>Centre for Industry 4.0 and Blockchain
            Research</strong>, I collaborate on research and participate in web3 events.  Outside academia, I founded and lead the
            <strong>Crypto Tamil Community</strong> (10,000+ members), advise 
 DeFi
            projects on strategy, and run validators on networks, keeping me deeply connected to the broader
            ecosystem.

          <h2>Portfolio Summary</h2>
          <p><strong>Goal:</strong> Build and grow inclusive Web3 communities while developing secure, scalable DeFi solutions. My portfolio documents how I combine research, product growth, and community management to drive adoption and innovation.</p>
          <p><strong>Tools:</strong> Discord, Twitter/X, Telegram, Google Analytics, CommonRoom, Dune Analytics, Solidity, Python, SQL, web3.js, Hardhat, Ganache, and GitHub.</p>
          <p><strong>Challenges:</strong> Translating complex DeFi concepts for newcomers, aligning distributed community members across time zones, managing regulatory compliance and security risks, and coordinating cross-functional teams.</p>
          <p><strong>Outcome:</strong> Scaled a community from 5k to 30k+ members, built data dashboards that reduced fraud exposure by 30%, developed Layer-2 scaling prototypes that improved throughput by 25%, and delivered open-source guidelines for secure DeFi development.</p>

        <!-- Research Section -->
        <section id="research">
          <h2>Research</h2>
          <p>My doctoral research, <em>Enhancing DeFi Protocol Resilience Across Ethereum and Layer 2 Networks</em>, investigates how to build secure, scalable, and interoperable DeFi infrastructure. I analyze on-chain data and historical incidents to identify smart-contract and liquidity vulnerabilities and design modular components—secure contract patterns, cross-chain liquidity safeguards, redundant oracle systems, and robust governance mechanisms. Prototypes are developed in Solidity and TypeScript and tested on Ethereum and Layer-2 networks to validate performance and security. The resulting framework and open-source library will serve developers, financial institutions and regulators seeking DeFi solutions that meet traditional finance expectations for risk management and reliability.</p>
